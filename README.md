### Misc Linux Scripting Projects

---

Various scripts I have written for projects.  

The OpenStack scripts were created for a Cinder project.
They are for displaying functionality more than being useful for practical work.

NOTE: dstat has been replaced by "dool" - csv output is broken and dstat is no longer active.
