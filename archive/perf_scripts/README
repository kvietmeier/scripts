The following script can be ran on any critical system over a period 
of time to help build a "profile" of system usage to help determine normal 
loads.

To run with the defaults untar the files into a directory and run the
"perf.sh" script:
  # ./perf.sh &

With each run of perf.sh, data will be collected and placed 
in a directory with the following format:

$HOSTNAME_mm_dd_hh:ss

NOTE:	By default this script is configured to gather 30 minutes of 
		performance data and will generate output in: 
		/tmp/$HOSTNAME_mm_dd_hh:ss


You can modify the script (perf.sh) to direct the data to another
location by changing the following line in perf.sh 
  export PERFDIR="/tmp/"
  example:
  export PERFDIR="${PERFDIRHOME}/runs"

  This would create a directory called runs under the directory 
  where perf.sh is run from.  Output would then be stored there. 

  example:
	 Putting the script in /opt/perf and creating directory called "runs"
	 results in - 
	 export PERFDIR="${PERFDIRHOME}/runs"

	 Output -
	 /opt/perf/runs
	  pegmatite_04_04_15:01/
	  pegmatite_04_04_15:05/


You will probably want to put the script into a cronjob so it can run unattended 
during the time periods you are interested in.  Here is an example crontab entry:
# Run performance script
30 8,9,11,13,15,22 * * *       /opt/perf/perf.sh  # 

This will run the script on the half hour every day at 08:30, 09:30, 11:30, 13:30
15:30, 22:30


When you are ready to send the output to Sun simply tar and compress the 
output directory then ftp the tar.gz file to "supportfiles.sun.com" and
put it in the cores directory.  When it is finished uploading notify 
your Sun support personel that it is finished so they can retrieve it.

# ftp supportfiles.sun.com
  (login as anonymous)
  ftp> cd /cores
  ftp> bin
  ftp> hash
  ftp> put <-filename->

  where <-filename-> is the name of the file to upload.
