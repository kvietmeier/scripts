### Source Files for a Flask based Globalnamespace demo

This demo uses a lightweight web-based image annotation workflow powered by Python, Flask, and Pillow, running on top of VAST Data’s Global Namespace (GNS).  It demonstrates how shared data access and live updates work seamlessly across geographically distributed clients by mounting the same GNS-backed view on multiple systems.
